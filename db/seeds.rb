# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# places = Place.create([
  # {name: "Old Dog Tavern", address: "402 E Kalamazoo Ave"},
  # {name: "The North Pole", address: "269 Rudolph Lane"},
  # {name: "Timbuktu", address: "444 Made Up Drive"},
#   {name: "#1 Dad", address: "29 Hi Hungry, I'm Dad Blvd"},
#   {name: "Foxy Grandpa", address: "80085 Hanging Circle"}
